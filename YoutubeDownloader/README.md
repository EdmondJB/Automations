This code creates a simple GUI window with a label and an entry field where you can enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to download. It also has a dropdown menu that allows you to select the desired resolution of the video. When you click the "Download Video" button, the code uses the ``pytube`` library to download the video in the selected resolution. The video will be saved to the current directory.

You will need to install the ``pytube`` and ``tkinter`` libraries in order to use this code. You can install these libraries using the ``pip`` package manager. For example, to install ``pytube``, you can use the following command:

``pip install pytube``

You can then use this command to install tkinter:

``pip install tkinter``
